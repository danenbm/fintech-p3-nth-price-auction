# Modified Vickrey Auction - Nth Price Sealed Bid

This smart contract implements decentralized multi-user price discovery marketplace auction. The auction awards one to the N items to the top N bidders at the price of the Nth highest bid.

Key Points of Auction Logic:
* Sealed Auction which means bidders can't see each other's bids
* Bidders can only bid once
* Multiple items (N items) can be up for auction
* The top N bidders pay the price that is the lowest bid out of the top N

Pro's of Auction:
* Encourages true value, willingness of what people want to pay
* Resistant to over and under bidding, competitive bidding wars
* No incentive to bid higher or lower
* Less cost and fees
* All bidders submit bids simultaneously
